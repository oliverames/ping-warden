# Licensing Follow-up Inventory — 2026-09-02

## Headline

- Public README surfaces now match the licensed build. The source stays MIT and everything except enabling Ping Protection in the prebuilt app is free. Enabling now requires a one-time $15 Gumroad license (https://olivera40.gumroad.com/l/pingwarden), with a 90-day grandfather window and a donor-honor path.

## What was changed in this pass (public surfaces)

- **README.md** — Intro now states MIT source + licensed prebuilt gate. Added Gumroad badge, Pricing nav link, install step 4 (activate in Settings → License, 14-day offline grace, 90-day transition, donor email), new `## Pricing` section with why-a-license rationale, donor note, and rewritten `## Support Ping Warden` and `## License` sections. All copy uses your consulting email as conversion path.

- **PingWarden/README.md** — Added `License` to Settings sections list, added 8.5 License pane docs, expanded `21. License and Pricing` with pricing, verification cadence, rationale, transition, and donor honor note.

- **PingWarden/QUICKSTART.md** — Inserted step 3 Activate your license and shifted turn-on/verify to steps 4–5, with Gumroad link, offline grace, transition, and donor note.

- **PingWarden/PingWarden/DonationPromptView.swift:40** — `Ping Warden stays free either way.` → `Ping Warden stays open source either way.` to avoid contradicting the new gate.

## Previous licensing code changes (not re-shipped in this pass)

- `PingWarden/PingWarden/Core/LicensePolicy.swift` — Pure Foundation policy (offlineGrace 14d, grandfather 90d), Gumroad response mapping, key normalization, request building.

- `PingWarden/PingWarden/LicenseManager.swift` — Keychain storage, App Group cache, grandfather seeding on first licensed-build launch when protection was already enabled, 6-hour reverify, fail-closed verify path. Product ID now live: `FmGG0pxyEyzJqp_BG4itFQ==` (permalink `pingwarden`, draft).

- `PingWarden/PingWarden/ProtectionExperienceCoordinator.swift` — Gates on `setPersistentProtection(true)` and `startSession`; grandfather-expiry vs never-licensed wording split; revocation disables protection immediately.

- `PingWarden/PingWarden/PingWardenApp.swift` — License settings pane (status, transition messaging with `isGrandfathered`, donor note with mailto, Buy link), welcome/setup handling, App Store launch notice window shown once per install, `transitionNoticeShown` flag, Support section copy, settings license nav.

- `PingWarden/PingWardenWidget/PingWardenWidgetLicenseGate.swift` + `PingWardenPreferences` + `PingWardenToggleIntent` — Widget reads same cached entitlement, throws `licenseRequired` when unlicensed.

## Shipping status

> **Superseded 2026-09-03.** Everything below described the pre-release state. Ping Warden 4.0.0 shipped on 2026-09-03: GitHub release `v4.0.0`, notarized `PingWarden-4.0.0.dmg`, appcast published to `gh-pages` (`347bb4b`) and committed on `main` (`df99141`), Sentry release `com.amesvt.pingwarden@4.0.0`, and the Gumroad product published and purchasable. See the 2026-09-03 WORKLOG entry.

## What was deliberately left alone at the time (pre-ship)

- **No release cut, no push to `main` or `gh-pages`, no `appcast.xml` bump, no DMG/notarization run.** Per the 2026-09-02 instruction; all of this ran on 2026-09-03.

- `LICENSE` — Stays MIT verbatim. The gate applies to the prebuilt binary only; source license does not change.

- `appcast.xml` — Historical release notes inside the appcast keep their original Buy Me a Coffee lines. No retroactive rewrite of shipped release notes.

- `PING_WARDEN_3_SPEC.md` — Internal spec still mentions Donate actions; left for you to decide if spec should track the licensed model. Not a public surface.

- Menu bar `Support Ping Warden` (cup icon) and About donate button — Kept as-is. They still open the Buy Me a Coffee URL; the docs now explain that post-release donations do not activate protection.

## Audit of remaining public surfaces (2026-09-02)

- `rg` scan for `free|MIT|donate|Buy Me` across README, QUICKSTART, TROUBLESHOOTING, PingWarden/README returned consistent copy after this pass. No surviving `remains free and open source whether you donate or not` lines.

- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — No licensing claims to update.

- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Historical entries left alone by intent. Next release notes should carry the same three facts as the READMEs: 90-day clock starts on first launch of the licensed build, license at the permalink above, pre-release donors honored at your consulting email.

- `PingWarden/README.md` table `What Ping Warden includes` — Ping Protection row still says `Keeps awdl0 down with an event-driven privileged helper`. Intentionally left: the table describes what the feature does, the pricing section describes the gate. No contradiction.

## Follow-up that still needs a decision (parked)

- **Donor offer, resolved September 9, 2026 ([#62](https://github.com/oliverames/ping-warden/issues/62)).** The product is published. A new private, product-specific 100% offer is active and stored in 1Password as "Ping Warden Private Donor Offer." Its code and URL are intentionally omitted here. The previously disclosed offer remains disabled. Verify donor eligibility before sharing the private link.

- **Spec doc.** If you want `PING_WARDEN_3_SPEC.md` to mention the License settings pane as a first-class surface, add it to the `Provide persistent ... actions in the menu, Settings, and` line.

- **Donation prompt, resolved September 9, 2026 ([#61](https://github.com/oliverames/ping-warden/issues/61)).** The donation sheet was removed for the licensed model. The unused launch-prompt policy and its tests have now been removed too. Earlier beta release notes describe historical behavior, not the current app. The separate license-transition reminder remains active for eligible unlicensed users.

## Verification

- `swift test` — 104 tests pass (including 25 new LicensePolicy tests).
- `xcodebuild -project PingWarden.xcodeproj -scheme PingWarden` Release — BUILD SUCCEEDED.
- `xcodebuild -scheme PingWardenWidget` Release — BUILD SUCCEEDED.
- Live Gumroad negative-path verify (bogus key against `FmGG0pxyEyzJqp_BG4itFQ==`) — returns 404 `success:false` as `LicensePolicy` expects (fail-closed).

## File map for this pass

- `README.md:36`, `:20`, `:24`, `:72`, `:94`, `:119`, `:149` — licensing, pricing, donor honor
- `PingWarden/README.md:144`, `:204`, `:385` — settings list, pane docs, pricing
- `PingWarden/QUICKSTART.md:23` — activation step
- `PingWarden/PingWarden/DonationPromptView.swift:40` — open-source wording

## Next ship checklist (when you say go)

1. Create and verify a real purchase with the live product (check key arrives by email, verify in Settings → License).
2. Decide on DonationPrompt suppression for licensed installs (optional).
3. Decide on offer code for donor conversions (optional but makes your email promise operational).
4. Draft `RELEASE_NOTES.md` top entry with the same pricing/transition/donor copy.
5. Publish product (`gumroad products publish`) and cut the release.
