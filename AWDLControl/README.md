# Ping Warden Full Documentation

This document is the detailed technical and operational guide for Ping Warden.

For quick setup, see [Quick Start](QUICKSTART.md). For issue recovery, see [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## 1. Overview

Ping Warden is a macOS latency-stability tool focused on preventing AWDL-related jitter and spikes for real-time workloads.

AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link) is used by Apple ecosystem features such as AirDrop, AirPlay, and Handoff. On some networks and workflows, AWDL interface transitions can correlate with sudden latency jumps. Ping Warden provides a controlled, user-friendly way to keep AWDL suppressed when desired, while retaining the ability to restore normal behavior instantly.

Primary goals:

- Keep latency stable for gaming, cloud streaming, and calls.
- Avoid repeated password prompts for normal day-to-day usage.
- Provide clear observability (status, ping history, interventions).
- Offer safe operational controls (enable/disable/pause/restore).

## 2. Why Not Just Run `sudo ifconfig awdl0 down`?

A one-time shell command might seem like a simple fix, but it doesn't actually solve the problem.

**The core issue:** macOS will bring AWDL back up automatically—often within seconds. You might write a script that polls every few seconds and takes AWDL down whenever it comes back up. This still introduces ping spikes during the seconds AWDL spools up. In some cases, this makes things *worse* because AWDL performs a channel scan each time it comes up, causing additional latency. Even reducing the polling interval to 0.5 seconds doesn't truly solve the problem—something at a deeper level is needed to prevent the system from ever calling the process to start.

**Why Ping Warden is different:** Instead of polling and reacting after AWDL is already up, the helper daemon listens to kernel route/interface events via `AF_ROUTE` sockets. When macOS signals that AWDL is coming up, the helper immediately counters the transition (sub-millisecond response) before the system can initiate its channel scan.

Additional benefits:

- **No repeated sudo prompts:** One-time approval during setup, then background operation.
- **Observability:** Live dashboard with ping history, intervention counts, and spike timeline.
- **Proper lifecycle:** Explicit startup, reconnect, health-check, and shutdown behavior.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

Ping Warden uses a split architecture:

- Main app (Swift/SwiftUI + AppKit bridge):
  - UI, settings, dashboard, diagnostics, automation, Sparkle updates.
- Helper daemon (Objective-C):
  - Privileged AWDL control and low-level monitoring.

Communication boundary:

- XPC service: `com.amesvt.pingwarden.xpc`
- Protocol: `AWDLHelperProtocol` (in `AWDLControl/Common/HelperProtocol.h`)

Registration model:

- Helper is registered using `SMAppService.daemon(plistName:)`.
- Registration requires one-time user approval in System Settings.

## 4. Key Components

### 4.1 Main App

Important files:

- `AWDLControl/AWDLControl/AWDLControlApp.swift`
- `AWDLControl/AWDLControl/AWDLMonitor.swift`
- `AWDLControl/AWDLControl/DashboardView.swift`
- `AWDLControl/AWDLControl/AWDLPreferences.swift`
- `AWDLControl/AWDLControl/DiagnosticsExporter.swift`

Responsibilities:

- Menu bar app behavior and settings window lifecycle.
- User intent state persistence (`isMonitoringEnabled`).
- Effective runtime state tracking (`effectiveMonitoringEnabled`).
- Dashboard data collection and charting.
- Sparkle update checks and update menu entries.

### 4.2 Helper Daemon

Important files:

- `AWDLControl/AWDLControlHelper/main.m`
- `AWDLControl/AWDLControlHelper/AWDLMonitor.h`
- `AWDLControl/AWDLControlHelper/AWDLMonitor.m`
- `AWDLControl/AWDLControlHelper/com.amesvt.pingwarden.helper.plist`

Responsibilities:

- Monitor interface change events through `AF_ROUTE`.
- Enforce desired AWDL state through `ioctl` on interface flags.
- Count and report interventions.
- Restore AWDL to enabled state when helper exits.

## 5. Monitoring Model and Timing Behavior

Core behavior:

- AWDL blocking mode means: keep `awdl0` down.
- Allow mode means: permit `awdl0` to remain up.
- Helper thread blocks on `poll()` waiting for:
  - Route/interface events (`AF_ROUTE` socket).
  - Internal control messages (`pipe`).

When monitoring is active and the system raises AWDL:

1. Kernel route event arrives.
2. Helper identifies `awdl0` state change (`RTM_IFINFO`).
3. Helper clears `IFF_UP` on `awdl0` via `SIOCSIFFLAGS`.
4. Intervention counter increments.

This is event-driven, not a delayed periodic shell loop.

## 6. State Model

Two state concepts are used:

- User intent state:
  - Preference for whether monitoring should be enabled.
  - Stored in user defaults.
- Effective runtime state:
  - Actual active status considering helper availability and XPC connectivity.

This separation allows robust behavior during reconnects, restarts, or temporary failures.

## 7. Setup and Approval Flow

Initial setup sequence:

1. Launch app.
2. App checks helper registration status via `SMAppService`.
3. If unregistered or approval required, user is guided to System Settings.
4. App polls registration status and proceeds once enabled.
5. XPC connection is activated.

The design avoids recurring password prompts after the one-time approval step.

## 8. Settings and UI Areas

Settings sections:

- Dashboard
- General
- Automation
- Advanced

### 8.1 Dashboard

Provides real-time latency visibility and tuning controls.

Cards include:

- Network Quality:
  - Current ping, average, best, worst, jitter, packet loss, AWDL state.
- Ping History:
  - Timeframe zoom windows: 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour.
  - Timeframe changes are non-destructive (history is not deleted by zoom changes).
- Latency Timeline:
  - Spike and intervention event list.
- AWDL Protection:
  - Intervention counter and explanatory status.
- Connection Settings:
  - Ping target selection.
  - Auto-select nearest endpoint.
  - Update interval selection.

Data retention behavior:

- Dashboard keeps a rolling history window (approximately one hour plus buffer).
- Chart zoom filters the in-memory history for display only.

### 8.2 General

Controls:

- AWDL Blocking toggle.
- Launch at Login.
- Show Dock Icon.
- Menu Dropdown Metrics (show current ping and interventions in menu dropdown).

Status block:

- Displays helper registration and effective blocking status.

### 8.3 Automation

Controls:

- Game Mode Auto-Detect (beta).
- Control Center Widget mode (beta, supported systems/signing only).

### 8.4 Advanced

Tools:

- Test Helper Response.
- Open Console logs.
- Export Diagnostics bundle.
- Re-register Helper.
- Uninstall flow.

## 9. Menu Bar and App Menu Integration

Menu bar:

- Primary AWDL toggle actions.
- Optional live metrics in dropdown.
- Settings/About/Update actions.

App menu (frontmost app state):

- `Check for Updates...` is injected/ensured when app is active with regular activation policy.
- This complements the status item update command.

## 10. Sparkle Update System

Update stack:

- Framework: Sparkle 2.x.
- Feed URL: `https://oliverames.github.io/ping-warden/appcast.xml`.
- Signature model: EdDSA (`SUPublicEDKey` in app plist).

Operational details:

- App clears stale user-default feed overrides at startup.
- Updater delegate provides canonical feed URL.
- Manual update checks available from both menu entry points.

Release wiring:

- `AWDLControl/AWDLControl/release.sh` signs artifacts and updates `appcast.xml`.
- GitHub release artifacts and appcast metadata must remain synchronized.

## 11. Security Model

Security controls include:

- Privileged helper exposed only through XPC interface.
- Optional code-signing requirements on incoming XPC connections in signed builds.
- Team ID-based signature validation in helper bootstrap path.
- Bounded error handling and controlled shutdown paths.

Notes:

- Unsigned/ad-hoc debug contexts are treated differently for local development.
- Production distribution should use Developer ID signing and notarization.

## 12. Diagnostics and Health Checks

Built-in diagnostics surface:

- Helper registration state.
- XPC reachability.
- Helper version and status calls.
- Current `awdl0` flags snapshot.
- Health check pass/fail messaging.
- Intervention counter and reset support.

Export diagnostics:

- Generates support-friendly snapshot data from app state and runtime checks.

## 13. Performance Characteristics

Design choices for low overhead:

- Event-driven helper thread using `poll()` rather than busy loops.
- Atomic counters and flags in helper for thread-safe fast paths.
- Narrow command surface over XPC.
- Dashboard sampling rate configurable by user.

## 14. Build and Development

Prerequisites:

- macOS 13+
- Xcode supporting project targets and current SDK requirements

Open in Xcode:

```bash
cd AWDLControl
open AWDLControl.xcodeproj
```

Build from CLI (example):

```bash
xcodebuild -project AWDLControl.xcodeproj -scheme AWDLControl -configuration Debug build
```

Key project areas:

- App target: UI and orchestration.
- Helper target: privileged monitoring and control.
- Widget target: optional control-center/menu integration path.

## 15. Release and Distribution

Typical release workflow:

1. Bump versions in project/plists.
2. Build and notarize release artifact.
3. Sign Sparkle update payload.
4. Insert/update appcast item with version, URL, signature, and size.
5. Publish GitHub release.
6. Verify Sparkle discovery from older installed app builds.

Important:

- Appcast latest entry must match the intended newest version.
- Feed URL in shipped app must resolve to current appcast location.

## 16. Limitations and Tradeoffs

Behavioral tradeoff while blocking AWDL:

- Apple features that depend on AWDL (for example AirDrop/AirPlay/Handoff) may be unavailable until blocking is disabled.

Other practical limits:

- Some automation features are beta and environment-dependent.
- Game mode detection depends on permissions and app/game behavior.
- Network conditions and endpoint choice still influence baseline latency.

## 17. Operational Best Practices

Recommended usage:

- Enable blocking before latency-sensitive sessions.
- Use dashboard target auto-select periodically if your network path changes.
- Keep update interval moderate unless actively investigating jitter.
- Use diagnostics export before opening support issues.
