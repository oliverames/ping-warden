Ping Warden (formerly AWDL Control) is an open source (MIT) macOS menu bar app built for cloud gaming on a Mac. AWDL can contribute to Wi-Fi stutters in GeForce NOW, Xbox Cloud Gaming, self-hosted streaming through Moonlight or Parsec, and other latency-sensitive games or calls. Ping Warden keeps it paused while you play. The source stays MIT and everything except enabling Ping Protection is free. Ping Protection watches Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL), the interface used by AirDrop, AirPlay, Handoff, and other nearby-device features, and keeps that interface down while it is active. The prebuilt app requires a one-time $15 license to enable Ping Protection. Eligible existing users receive the [90-day transition described below](#pricing). Visit [pingwarden.app](https://pingwarden.app/) for the product website and [complete documentation](https://pingwarden.app/docs/).

</p>

## The tradeoff

Ping Protection temporarily makes AirDrop, AirPlay, Handoff, and other AWDL-dependent features unavailable on your Mac. Turn protection off when you need them, or use the 10-minute pause from the menu bar. Ping Warden restores AWDL when protection stops and during its removal flow.

That tradeoff is the point of the app. You choose when a latency-sensitive game or call matters more than nearby-device features.

## Why this exists

Running `sudo ifconfig awdl0 down` once is not enough because macOS can bring AWDL back up within seconds. A timer-based script reacts after the interface is already active, which still leaves time for channel switching to affect the connection.

## How it works

Ping Warden uses a privileged helper that waits for kernel route and interface events. When macOS tries to raise `awdl0` while Ping Protection is on, the helper takes it back down and increments an intervention counter. The dashboard puts that counter next to live latency, jitter, probe failures, and history so you can see what happened on your own network.

## Install, approve, and verify

### 1. Get the app

Buy the [Ping Warden License on Gumroad](https://amesconsulting.gumroad.com/l/pingwarden). The signed, notarized DMG is attached to the purchase, so it is in your receipt and your Gumroad library, and the license key arrives in the same email. Open the DMG, drag Ping Warden to `/Applications`, and launch the copy in Applications.

Want to try the free features first? The same build is on [Releases](https://github.com/oliverames/ping-warden/releases/latest). Everything except enabling Ping Protection works without a key, and any official build accepts the key from a later purchase.

**Already have an older version and never see update prompts?** Before 4.1.6, automatic update checks only started once the privileged helper was approved, so an install that only used the free dashboard was never offered anything. Choose **Check for Updates** from the menu bar icon, or download the current build above and drag it over the copy in Applications. From 4.1.6 onward the checks run whether or not the helper is approved. See [updating from an earlier version](Site/guides/updating-from-an-earlier-version.md).

### 2. Activate your license

Open **Settings → License** and enter the key from your receipt. The app verifies once with Gumroad and then works offline for up to 14 days. If you have an active transition, protection remains available until the deadline shown in that pane. If you donated through Buy Me a Coffee before version 4, email [oliver@ames.consulting](mailto:oliver@ames.consulting) with your receipt and it will be honored as a full license.

### 3. Approve the helper

The welcome appears automatically once. Choose **Not Now** to use the free dashboard and finish setup later.

In the welcome window, click **Turn On Ping Protection** after activation. If you already closed it, open **Settings → General** and click **Finish Setup**. Approve Ping Warden in System Settings when macOS asks. This one-time approval lets the app control wireless sharing.

### 4. Turn on Ping Protection and verify it

Enable **Ping Protection** from the menu bar. Without a key (and outside the transition window) the app points you back to **Settings → License** instead of turning protection on. Open the dashboard and confirm that protection is active. The dashboard shows live latency and counts each time the helper blocks macOS from reactivating AWDL.

The [Quick Start guide](PingWarden/QUICKSTART.md) covers first-run setup and the optional automation features.

## What Ping Warden includes

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| Ping Protection | Keeps `awdl0` down with an event-driven privileged helper |
| Live dashboard | Tracks latency, jitter, probe failures, history, and helper interventions |
| Game Mode auto-detect | Turns protection on when a recognized game is the frontmost app, with no permission needed; optional Screen Recording access also catches fullscreen games behind other windows |
| Quick pause | Restores nearby-device features for 10 minutes, then returns to your previous protection state |
| Control Center widget | Provides a system toggle on macOS 26 or newer in signed release builds |
| Diagnostics export | Creates a local support snapshot that you can review before sharing |
| Automatic updates | Uses Sparkle and signed update metadata to deliver new releases |

Apple added third-party Mac controls to Control Center in [macOS Tahoe 26](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/278/?time=536), which is why the widget has a newer requirement than the rest of the app.

Ping targets include common public services, discovered GeForce NOW regions, your network gateway, and targets you add yourself.

## Pricing

Ping Warden stays open source under MIT. You can build from source, inspect it, and modify it under MIT whether you pay or not. The prebuilt, signed, and notarized app is free to download and everything except enabling Ping Protection is free to use.

**Why a license:** After two years of free builds, donations cover only a fraction of the ongoing work — Developer ID signing, Apple notarization, testing across macOS releases, and release engineering. A one-time $15 license for the Ping Protection feature makes that work sustainable without subscriptions, ads, or analytics. The tradeoff that defines this app stays exactly the same, and the source stays auditable under MIT.

Enabling Ping Protection in the prebuilt app requires that license at [Gumroad](https://amesconsulting.gumroad.com/l/pingwarden). One key works on the Macs you own. The app verifies once with Gumroad, then re-checks roughly every 6 hours while it runs and once at launch; verification is offline-friendly for up to 14 days.

**Transition for existing users:** If protection was enabled with an approved helper when you first launched version 4, it remains available for 90 days from that launch. Updates preserve the original deadline. Check the time remaining in **Settings → License**. When the transition ends, enter a license key to keep protection available. The app introduces the transition once and reminds eligible users twice more, when 30 days and 7 days remain, showing the days left. Reminders wait until a detected game or latency session ends and stop after license activation. A reminder missed while the app was closed does not stack with the next one.

**Donors:** If you supported Ping Warden through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/oliverames) before version 4, email [oliver@ames.consulting](mailto:oliver@ames.consulting) with your receipt and it will be honored as a full license.

## Privacy

Latency history, protection state, settings, and intervention counts stay on your Mac. Ping Warden does not send usage analytics.

The app makes a few narrow outbound requests:

- Sparkle checks the public appcast for updates.
- License activation and refresh send your license key and the product ID to Gumroad over HTTPS. Your key stays in the macOS Keychain between checks.
- The dashboard checks `status.geforcenow.com` to discover GeForce NOW target hostnames.
- Anonymous crash reporting is off by default. If you opt in under **Settings > Advanced > Privacy**, reports exclude IP addresses, ping targets, network breadcrumbs, performance traces, and app-lifecycle tracking.
- TCP latency probes connect only to the target you select or ask Ping Warden to choose.

Diagnostics exports are written locally. Ping Warden never uploads them for you.

## Support Ping Warden

The source stays MIT and you can build it yourself whether you buy anything or not. The prebuilt, signed, and notarized app is free to download and everything except enabling Ping Protection is free to use.

If you supported Ping Warden on [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/oliverames) before version 4, email [oliver@ames.consulting](mailto:oliver@ames.consulting) with your receipt and I'll honor it as a full license. New licenses are a one-time $15 at [Gumroad](https://amesconsulting.gumroad.com/l/pingwarden) and cover the Macs you own. Donations since version 4 still help with signing and testing. To activate Ping Protection, purchase the Gumroad license.
