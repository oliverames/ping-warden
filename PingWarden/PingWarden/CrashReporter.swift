//
//  CrashReporter.swift
//  PingWarden
//
//  Anonymous crash reporting via Sentry. The Sentry SDK is added as an SPM
//  dependency; this file is inert (no-op) until the package is linked,
//  thanks to the `#if canImport(Sentry)` guards.
//
//  Privacy posture (matches the app's stated promise):
//    • Default ON when no choice is stored; users can opt out via
//      Settings → Advanced → Privacy. Existing saved choices persist.
//    • No stored IP address (server-side scrubbing; sendDefaultPii = false).
//    • No network breadcrumbs, spans, or failed-request events — those
//      would otherwise leak updater and TCP-probe URLs into crash payloads.
//    • No performance tracing or profiling — crashes only.
//    • No app-lifecycle session tracking (enableAutoSessionTracking = false).
//    • beforeSend re-checks the preference as defense-in-depth, so a
//      racing toggle-off between SDK init and first event still suppresses.
